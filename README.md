# 4-Dimensional-Object-Simulator
A Unity project that allows you to define 4-Dimensional points and lines to construct objects to then rotate/move them. In the end, you can see the intriguing shapes and movements they make when they are orthographically cast back down to 3D. This project was made for the Canada-Wide Science Fair 2018, winning the Perimeter Institute ISSYP prize. The source code was unfortunately lost, but feel free to explore the project and develop something similar. You can ask me anything about the implementation as well.
